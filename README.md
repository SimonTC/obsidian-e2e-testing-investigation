# obsidian-e2e-testing-investigation
This repository contains my (failed) investigations into using end-to-end testing frameworks to test Obsidian plugins.

I have tested the follwoing frameworks: 
- Webdriver.io
- Playwright

I have had the most luck with Webdriver.io since I am able to open the target vault, but I am not able to interact with that vault.
